The Debian Package tweetian
----------------------------

Comments regarding the Package

This is an updated version of original Tweetian for Harmattan, called 'Tweetian Reloaded'.
I am trying to do few update to this nice Twitter client for th N9, starting from the issues caused by the time,
like the 140 char limit, and the absence of images.

Also, will improve the UI, following more strictly the (old) Nokia UX guideline, and correcting
some little UI issue there and there.

The old repo was locked, so I cloned a new one there: 
https://github.com/minodesign/Tweetian_reloaded

You are welcome as a QT, QML, or C++ developer!
In next weeks, will add a list of #issues to solve, under the hood.
